" "text_two" "Dr. Lawson is an active member of the Transportation Research Board, having served six years as Chair of the Urban Transportation Data and Information Systems Committee (ABJ30). She was a member of ABJ30 for nine years, served as Secretary for three years, and received a TRB Blue Ribbon Award for her contributions to urban transportation data collection, analysis, and archiving strategies and the establishment of cutting-edge subcommittees, including Computational Transportation and Society (ABJ30(2)). As Chair, she was also responsible for the Subcommittee on Census Data for Transportation Planning (ABJ30(1)). Dr. Lawson was as member of the NCHRP Project 20-5, Topic 42-02 Use of U.S. Census Bureau’s Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) by States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations. She has participated in a number of census workshops, including those focused on the American Community Survey and the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP). She has also been a member of the National Research Council Subcommittee on Data Research since 2004. She is currently a member of the Public Transit Executive Board (AP000), a member of the Data and Information Systems Section(ABJ00), and Chair of the newly formed Joint Subcommittee on Transformative Trends in Transit Data." "text_three" "Her research interests include: advanced uses of archived intelligent transportation systems (ITS) data and spatial analysis/geographic information systems (GIS) applications for transportation planning and analysis for passenger travel, transit (including ferries), and freight. As the Director of the Lewis Mumford Center (LMC) at the University at Albany, she established the University at Albany Visualization and Informatics Lab (AVAIL), a “new generation” research lab, specializing in advanced data-driven visualization and informatics, using data science strategies and techniques." "text_four" "Dr. Lawson has extensive knowledge of travel surveys, particularly activity-based surveys (e.g., the Portland, Oregon activity dataset used in her dissertation). She previously conducted research for NYMTC, reviewing their surveying practices and recommending the use of GPS for a series of NYMTC pilot studies. She has also conducted extensive research on the best practices for GPS data management, including the use of compression and query science with the development of the SQUISH algorithm. " )}}
